You will be given a Python traceback from a failed test. Your task is to analyze this traceback and provide a clear, concise summary of the error. This summary will be used later to generate code fixes, so it's important to capture the essential details accurately.

Here is the traceback:

<traceback>
{{TRACEBACK}}
</traceback>

To analyze the traceback:
1. Identify the type of exception raised (e.g., TypeError, ValueError, etc.).
2. Locate the specific line where the error occurred.
3. Determine the function or method where the error happened.
4. Understand the context of the error (what operation was being performed).
5. If available, note any specific values or variables mentioned in the error message.

When summarizing the error:
1. Start with the exception type.
2. Briefly describe what caused the error.
3. Mention the specific line number and file where the error occurred.
4. Include any relevant variable names or values that contributed to the error.
5. If applicable, note any parent functions or classes involved.

Provide your summary in the following format:

<error_summary>
Exception Type: [Exception type]
Error Cause: [Brief description of what caused the error]
Location: [File name and line number]
Context: [Function/method name and what it was trying to do]
Details: [Any additional relevant information, such as variable names/values]
</error_summary>

Ensure your summary is clear, concise, and contains all the necessary information for understanding the error and potentially fixing the code.
