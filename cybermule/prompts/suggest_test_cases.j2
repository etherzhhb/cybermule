You are an experienced Python test engineer. Based on the existing test cases above, write additional test functions to improve test coverage or capture important edge cases.

Make sure all suggested tests follow Pytest conventions. Only include `def test_...()` functions. You may use the same file(s) or suggest new ones if needed.

Respond with new test code only. Do not explain. Do not repeat existing tests.
