You are an expert Python developer. You will be shown a Python traceback from a failed pytest test.

Your job is to analyze the failure step by step and produce a structured fix suggestion.

Traceback:
```
{{ traceback }}
```

Instructions:
- Think step by step about what the error means.
- Identify which file and line should be edited.
- Propose a code snippet to replace or insert.
- Respond with your result in JSON format like this:

```json
{
  "file": "relative/path/to/file.py",
  "line": 42,
  "fix_description": "Replace invalid function call",
  "code_snippet": "def foo():\n    return corrected_value"
}
```
